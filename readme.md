# CS 3003 Final Password Manager
Solo Command Line Password Manager written in Java that implements AES algorithms from the Java crypto library to encrypt a list of serializable password objects sent to a text file. Subsequent runs of the program will decrypt the file and deserialize the objects into a working list to view the passwords.  New passwords are added to the working list, and then the file is overwritten with the data from the new list.
